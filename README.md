This repository demonstrates a common issue with the Firebase Authentication SDK: unhelpful error messages when authentication fails. The `firebaseBug.js` file shows how a generic error message is thrown without sufficient detail to diagnose the root cause. The solution, shown in `firebaseBugSolution.js`, involves adding more robust error handling and logging to provide more context and specific error messages.
