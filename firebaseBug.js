The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's credential is invalid or if there's a network issue during authentication.  The error messages aren't always very descriptive, making debugging difficult. For example, a generic 'auth/network-request-failed' doesn't pinpoint the exact cause (is it a network problem, a server issue, or an invalid credential?).
